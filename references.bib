abstract = {The Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) started as part of an academic research project funded by the UK government at the beginning of the 1990's, with several goals in mind:

 	To make freely available a robust and portable compiler for Haskell that generates high performance code;
 	To provide a modular foundation that other researchers can extend and develop;
 	To learn how real programs behave, so that we can design and build better compilers.

GHC is now over 20 years old, and has been under continuous active development since its inception. Today, GHC releases are downloaded by hundreds of thousands of people, the online repository of Haskell libraries has over 3,000 packages, GHC is used to teach Haskell in many undergraduate courses, and there are a growing number of instances of Haskell being depended upon commercially.},

abstract="The last decade has seen a number of approaches to datatype-generic programming: PolyP, Functorial ML, `Scrap Your Boilerplate', Generic Haskell, `Generics for the Masses', and so on. The approaches vary in sophistication and target audience: some propose full-blown programming languages, some suggest libraries, some can be seen as categorical programming methods. In these lecture notes we compare the various approaches to datatype-generic programming in Haskell. We introduce each approach by means of example, and we evaluate it along different dimensions (expressivity, ease of use, and so on).",

Signal Temporal Logic (STL) emerges as a convenient and powerful formalism for continuous and hybrid systems. This paper presents an efficient algorithm for computing the robustness degree in which a piecewise-continuous signal satisfies or violates an STL formula. The algorithm, by leveraging state-of-the-art streaming algorithms from Signal Processing, is linear in the size of the signal and its implementation in the Breach tool is shown to outperform alternative implementations.",

abstract="This paper is motivated by the need for a formal specification method for real-time systems. In these systemsquantitative temporal properties play a dominant role. We first characterize real-time systems by giving a classification of such quantitative temporal properties. Next, we extend the usual models for temporal logic by including a distance function to measure time and analyze what restrictions should be imposed on such a function. Then we introduce appropriate temporal operators to reason about such models by turning qualitative temporal operators into (quantitative) metric temporal operators and show how the usual quantitative temporal properties of real-time systems can be expressed in this metric temporal logic. After we illustrate the application of metric temporal logic to real-time systems by several examples, we end this paper with some conclusions.",

        abstract = {In many modern applications, data may take the form of infinite "data streams", rather than finite stored data sets.  Several aspects of data management need to be reconsidered in the presence of data streams, offering a new research direction for the database community. In this paper we focus primarily on the problem of query processing, specifically on how to define and evaluate "continuous queries" over data streams.  We address semantic issues as well as efficiency concerns.  Our main contributions are threefold.  First, we specify a general and flexible architecture for query processing in the presence of data streams.  Second, we use our basic architecture as a tool to clarify alternative semantics and processing techniques for continuous queries.  The architecture also captures most previous work on continuous queries and data streams, as well as related concepts such as triggers and materialized views.  Finally, we map out research topics in the area of query processing over data streams, showing where previous work is relevant and describing problems yet to be addressed. Please note that this paper was prepared as a ``vision'' contribution.  Its main goal is to identify in detail what we believe to be an interesting new research direction, which also happens to have near-term practical relevance.}
